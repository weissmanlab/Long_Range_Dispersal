This repository contains simulation codes and data for isolation by distance of spatially structured populations with long range dispersal.  

- C++ codes with compilations and execution details can be found in the Simulation_codes directory

- Data from simulation runs and plots from these runs (in a Mathematica notebook) can be found in data_and_mathematica_plots

- Cartoon figures used to illustrate the model can be found in the cartoons directory

- IBD_model_distinction_range_estimate contains an R code we used to make rough estimates of the range of spatial scales necessary to distinguish long range dispersal from short range dispersal
