This repository contains simulation codes and data for isolation by distance of spatially structured populations with long range dispersal.  

- C++ codes with compilations and execution details can be found in the Simulation_codes directory

- Data from simulation runs and plots from these runs (in a Mathematica notebook) can be found in the data_and_plots directory

- Images used for figures in the paper can be found in data_and_plots/images

- IBD_range_estimates contains an R code we used to make rough estimates of the range of spatial scales necessary to distinguish long range dispersal from short range dispersal
